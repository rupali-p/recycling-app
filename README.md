# recycling-app

## Introduction

The recycling-app is a application (platform TBD) that allows a user to upload or scan a recycling code on an item and recieve instructions on how to best recycle it. The goal of this is to encourage people to correctly recycle their rubbish.

This project was done as a project for the Software Innovation Studio 

### Git commit policy. 

Branch names will be named as follows
- sprint-number/tribe name

  For example: 1/back-end, 1/ml
  
- When a feature from a tribe is complete, members should tag another member of their tribe to review and approve the changes before it is merged.
- A pull request name should match the name of the ticket on trello. 
- When a sprint has been completed and all tribes branches for that sprint have been stablised (free of bugs or crashes), a member of that tribe will need to submit a PR for the branch changes to be merged with the 'dev' branch
- Once the dev branch has been stablished with all requests, that branch should be merged with the main branch.
